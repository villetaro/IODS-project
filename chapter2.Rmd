# Chapter 2: My data analysis

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using  

#2.1 Opening the data and checking the structure. I run the codes in chapter2.R as i doesn't seem to work in here

read.table("~/GitHub/IODS-project/data/learning2014.csv")
str(learning2014)

- The data has 166 observations and now 7 variables. Variables contain gender, age, attitude, deep learning, strategic learning, surface learning and points.

#2.2 I drew the data as ggplot picture and modified it a bit.
